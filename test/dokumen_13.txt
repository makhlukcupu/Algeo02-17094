The Cure for CoVID-19

There is no cure for the vast majority of human pathogenic viruses including CoVID-19. 
We are sick until our body devises a way to kill the invader. 
Our bodies have many defense plans to counter a viral attack. 
The first line of defense is to understand the vector of infection: “one if by hand, two if by spittle and three if by air”. 
Not really, but our immune systems do need time to identify the invading virus and let the rest of the body know about the invasion. 
Our bodies create specific proteins to attack and more importantly mark the invader virus with something like a “Scarlet Letter” so our warrior cells, called lymphocytes can identify them and devour them. 
Each virus requires a unique counter-attack and this takes time. 
Think of a virus infection as a race between the virus trying to make as many Minnie-Me(s) as possible and 
our body’s immune system struggling to devise and implement a defense plan. 
For this reason, people who are immuno-compromised (i.e., have a weakened immune system) are most vulnerable to virus infection. 
Immuno-compromised people include the elderly (over 70), people who are already sick from another disease, 
people taking chemotherapy to fight cancer, and children who don’t have a fully developed immune system. 
There is a CoVID-19 exception for children. 
For some reason, still unexplained, children under the age of 14 do not seem to be affected by CoVID-19 at the same rate and intensity as adults.
