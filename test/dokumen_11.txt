How CoVID-19 Got Its Name

CoVID-19 actually has two names. 
It was given a formal name using international conventions that go like this. 
CoVID-19 is in the class of viruses known for having “crowns” on the surface of their envelopes. 
The first definition of the Latin word “corona” is crown — the second definition is “beer with lime”. 
It was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 
So, its formal name according to convention is, “Corona Virus Identified in 2019”. 
That name was too long and no one liked saying it, so it was given the nickname, “CoVID-19”, that we all use today.

CoVID-19 is related to the virus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003/2004. 
That virus had the name, CoV-SARS, which stood for “Corona Virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome”. 
CoVID-19’s other name is “CoV-SARS-2”, but no one uses it.
