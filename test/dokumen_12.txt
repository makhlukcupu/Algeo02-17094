How You Get Infected

Our principle exposure to CoVID-19 is coming into close contact with an infected person. 
Typically, you are exposed when someone close to you (as in proximity, not as in relationship)
coughs or sneezes either directly on you, your clothing, or on a surface that you later touch like your iPhone. 
Viruses in dried spittle from an infected person can be found on 
kitchen counters, doorknobs, telephones, light switches, water faucets, handrails, computer keyboards etc. 
The exact amount of time the virus can survive in dried spittle is unknown. 
Data suggests it can survive from 2 to 7 days. Viruses cannot penetrate your skin. 
You become infected when you touch the contaminated surface and CoVID-19 takes a joy ride on your finger or hand 
until you touch exposed body tissue, typically on your face like rubbing your eyes, 
poking your nose, or using your fingernail to get that piece of orange pulp stuck between your teeth. 
I’ll say it again. The most frequent form of virus transmission is by getting coughed or sneezed on, 
and data suggests that you can get infected from touching a contaminated surface for up to 7 days after the surface became contaminated.

Once transferred to your body tissue, the virus spreads throughout your body and implements a Dr. Evil-like master plan 
to enslave your cells and force them to make many copies of the virus. That is right, think of many “Minnie Me” evil doers.
So, wash your hands (like 10 times a day) and stop touching your face. You just touched your face! Yes, you did. I saw you.
