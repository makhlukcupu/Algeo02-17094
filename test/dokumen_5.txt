Failure to detect the virus
Health experts are concerned that the country is failing to identify the transmission of the virus.[208] Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, "analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report ... that Indonesia might have missed cases" of coronavirus disease 2019.[209][210][211] Western diplomats[212][213][214] as well as local[208][215] and international[216][217][218] news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention.[219][220]

On 22 March, a research suggested that the official number of infections may only reflect 2% of the real COVID-19 infections in Indonesia.[221][222] According to The Jakarta Post on 5 April 2020, the central government has only conducted a daily average of 240 PCR tests since 2 March.[223]

Budget for foreign social media influencers
The government faced backlash after instead pledging to set aside IDR 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social media influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia.[224]

Lack of transparency
Indonesian president Joko Widodo is also criticized by Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,[225] human rights groups,[226] and also by political party such as Golkar and PKS[227][228] for lack of transparency regarding the information of the COVID-19. Widodo have insisted not to share the travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public.[229] The public had asked the government to release official national map of COVID-19 confirmed cases' location, as unofficial independent maps may provide incorrect data.[230]

Tests and treatment
Reports have surfaced about patients in Greater Jakarta having to wait for a long time to get tests or treatment for possible cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as referral hospitals face the increasing strain.[231]

Lockdown policies
Joko Widodo has come under increased pressure to impose a partial lockdown on virus-plagued areas, with scientists saying the country is racing against time to curb the spread of COVID-19 before Eid al-Fitr and that a community quarantine could be the only solution to do exactly that.[232] On 16 March, Jokowi said lockdown policies are the authority of the central government, and warned the local government to not impose lockdown without the consent of the central authority.[233]

On 27 March, dozens of Indonesian medical professors have called for "local lockdowns", saying that the government's policy of physical distancing is not "effective". The government is drafting a regulation (PP) to stipulate the procedures and requirements for imposing regional quarantines.[234][235]

Censorship
Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic.[236]

Additional death rates excluded from official counts
According to a report from Reuters, as of 28 April 2020, there were around 2,200 patients who had died with coronavirus symptoms, but not included into the official death toll of 693. This suggests that Indonesia has a higher death rate than the official counts.[237] An analysis by Financial Times showed that there were 1,400 more deaths in Jakarta compared to the historical average number of deaths in March and April. This excess deaths figure is 15 times the official figure of 90 COVID-19 deaths in this same period.[238]

Evasion of travel restrictions
"Ramadan exodus" contributed to the spread of the virus in Indonesia,[239] despite government regulations on social distancing and despite a lockdown slated to run until June.[240]

Also, despite the travel restrictions which suspends all passengers to travel outside areas with at least one confirmed case, many Indonesians disregarded it and have attempted to evade the travel restrictions in order to return to hometown during Eid al-Fitr season. This has caused scientists to raise concern that this evasion will lead to the diseases which can spread easily from Jakarta and nearby satellite cities, where it is the epicenter of the pandemic, to other regions of Indonesia with weak medical facilities which are unable to handle large numbers of outbreak.[241]

There are also few attempts on evading the travel restrictions which had been discovered by the police department, such as one of the cargo trucks was stopped only to found out the intermodal container is hiding a car with passengers inside to be transported from Java to Sumatra, and additional four cargo trucks were also detained when the driver attempting to bring 20 passengers from Jakarta inside the containers which were covered with tarpaulin.[241]

Lack of safety in tobacco industries
Despite the temporary closure of HM Sampoerna due to two workers dying from COVID-19, with additional 63 workers tested positive, Pandu Riono, the epidemiologist from University of Indonesia reported that other cigarette factories in East and West Java will continue to operate without practicing social distancing and workers never wearing face masks. This sparks concern that the cigarette factories could create new clusters for the coronavirus outbreak considering that this industry usually has large workforce.[
