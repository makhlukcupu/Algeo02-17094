What You Can Do

The greatest risk of exposure (i.e., catching the virus) occurs at places where people meet or gather, 
such as, church and schools, retail stores and malls, nightclubs and transportation hubs like airports and train stations. 
Essentially, any place people get together and are likely to come within one meter, or three feet of each other. 
For this reason, many sporting events and conferences are being cancelled or postponed.

If you attend a place where people gather, consider a fist bump or a Buddhist bow of gratitude instead of shaking hands. 
Shaking hands is an exposure multiplier. 
When you shake someone’s hand you are not doubling your exposure, 
you are increasing your risk of exposure by a multiplier equal to the number of potentially contaminated surfaces
the other person’s hand touched prior to touching you.
Carry a pen with you at all times. 
Avoid using the pen provided when paying for a meal, signing for a purchase or taking notes at a class or conference.
Make a habit of using a finger other than your index finger to do mundane tasks because you touch your face most frequently with your index finger. 
Use your little finger to sign at checkout, when entering a PIN at an ATM machine etc. 
Use your little finger because you are unlikely to use that finger to touch your face, rub your eyes or wipe your lips. 
By concentrating on using your little finger, you will also be reminded of the other precautions you should be taking.
