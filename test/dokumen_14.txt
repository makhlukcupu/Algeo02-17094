Do Vaccines Cure Us
In case you were absent that day, vaccinations can protect us from viruses like CoVID-19 but do not cure us. 
It takes time to develop and test an effective vaccine. 
Vaccine development and preparation can be quite complex, but in its simplest form, 
a vaccine is a sterile-water filled syringe containing millions of dead viruses floating around in the water. 
The viruses cannot attack our cells BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD, but our body doesn’t know they are recently deceased and attacks them anyway. 
The presence of the dead viruses in our body triggers a full immune response including the creation of virus-specific proteins and activated warrior cells. 
It is not a fair fight! The dead viruses lose every time. 
Our immune system has an exceptional memory and will be immediately ready to fight that virus if it ever sees it again. 
With this giant head start, the virus is guaranteed to lose in a future infection because — — we are immunized, which is sort of like a Super Power.
We can expect there will be a vaccine for CoVID-19 in the future. 
In the meantime, our best defense is to delay our exposure or avoid catching CoVID-19 altogether.
