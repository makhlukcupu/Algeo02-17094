According to the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, a regency or municipality may be classified into three levels depending on the severity of COVID-19 cases within the region, according to these parameters:[34]

The number of positive cases within 14 days
The number of suspected cases within 14 days
The number of deaths buried according to COVID-19 protocol within 14 days
Threat of disease contagions to healthcare workers
Each has a score of 15 points for increasing trends, 20 for stationary trends, and 25 for decreasing trends.

The three levels will be assigned to a specific region:

Red Zone if the total score reaches below 80 points. Large-scale social restrictions may be enforced.
Yellow Zone if the total score reaches 80 to 95 points.
Green Zone if the total score reaches 100 points (all 4 parameters show a decreasing trend).
