The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
It was confirmed to have spread to Indonesia on 2 March 2020, after a dance instructor and her mother tested positive for the virus. Both were infected from a Japanese national.
By 9 April, the pandemic had spread to all 34 provinces in the country. 
Jakarta, East Java, and West Java are the worst-hit provinces, together accounting almost 48% of the national total cases. 
The largest increase of new cases in a single day occurred on 8 October, when 4,850 cases were announced.
At most 5,810 recoveries and 160 fatalities were ever recorded within a span of 24 hours. On 13 July, the recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.
As of 12 November, Indonesia has reported 452,291 cases, the highest in Southeast Asia, ahead of the Philippines. 
In terms of death numbers, Indonesia ranks third in Asia and 15th in the world.
Review of data, however, indicated that the number of deaths may be much higher than what has been reported as those who died with acute COVID-19 symptoms but had not been confirmed or tested were not counted in the official death figure.
